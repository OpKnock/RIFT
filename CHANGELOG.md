# Changelog

All notable changes to RIFT. Versions follow SemVer; `0.x` signals a lab system, not a certified product.

## [0.6.0] — Counterfactual Laboratory release candidate
### Engine and science
- Exact robust enumeration baseline with QAOA statevector comparison (expectation + lowest-cost-tail CVaR, α=0.25).
- Least-squares quadratic projection for multi-variable QAOA with reported max/mean objective gap.
- Independent Guardian verification over nominal + every declared perturbation.
- Bounded scenario inputs, policy/perturbation limits, and explicit simulator caps (12 qubits, 16 policy vars).

### Product boundaries
- Serializable experiment specs with fingerprints (`src/rift/experiments.py`).
- Unified Supabase adapter with lifecycle/status endpoints (migrations 001→004).
- Optional service-token gate + server-side ownership checks.
- Lemon Squeezy checkout/webhook boundary with HMAC verification, idempotent processing, subscription lifecycle mapping, and server-derived entitlements.
- Hardened HTTP layer: request IDs, structured logs, security headers, bounded payloads, sanitized errors.

### Frontend, CI, docs
- Lab UI with system status, local history, settings/capabilities, reproducibility metadata, and honest error states.
- CI runs pytest plus migration/secret/version validation gates.
- Docs: setup, API, experiments, billing, security (with residual risks), deployment (+Dockerfile), review policy, release checklist.
